\section{Introduction}

% talk about satellite tracking and how it is a difficult problem to solve.

% Satellite-Based Ground Tracking is a cornerstone of modern Space Domain Awareness (SDA), enabling the detection, monitoring, and management of critical ground targets such as missile launches, military assets, and environmental threats. 
% By leveraging advanced space-based sensors, these systems provide a unique vantage point for tracking high-speed or concealed objects, offering real-time intelligence that is essential for national security, disaster response, and strategic operations. 
% However, this field is filled with challenges, including the need to accurately fuse measurements from multiple satellites, respond to dynamic threats online, and manage the limitations of satellite compute and communications.
% Additionally, all of these problems typically need to be acomplished autonomously; to expedite speed and response. 
% This paper will be discussing how compute and communication limitations can be addressed by leveraging optimization and data fusion techniques.


Satellite-Based Ground Tracking is a cornerstone of modern Space Domain Awareness (SDA), enabling the detection, monitoring, and management of critical ground targets such as missile launches, military assets, and environmental threats. 
By leveraging advanced space-based sensors, satellites can collect high vantage point measurements on potential targets. These measurements are then processed by advanced data fusion algorithms that are able to generate a high-fidelity track of an object.
This allows real-time intelligence that is essential for national security, disaster response, and strategic operations.
However, this field is filled with challenges, including the need to accurately fuse measurements from multiple satellites, respond to dynamic threats online, and manage the limitations of satellite compute and communications.
Additionally, all of these problems typically need to be acomplished autonomously; to expedite speed and response. 
This paper will be discussing how compute and communication limitations can be addressed by leveraging optimization and data fusion techniques.
